# bioassayEstimation
Develop simple models to estimate bioassay for active compounds discovery.

## Prerequisite
This project contains two different models: **Linear Regression model** using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and **Neural Network model** using [keras](https://keras.io/).
Please install required package before running the codes.
```
pip install tensorflow, keras
```

## Model Evaluation
For such a regression problem, I simply derive mean absolute error as an indicator of the model performance.

Further research and more complex model can be applied in the future to improve the performance.
